	/// <summary>
	/// Defines the interface for an object that can perform the ISaveDevice operations in
	/// an asynchronous fashion.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// This class was based on the event-based asynchronous pattern, which is the new
	/// recommended method for asynchronous APIs in .NET. For more information, see this page:
	/// http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hkasytyf.aspx
	/// 
	/// Our pattern deviates from the standard in that our events don't use the standard
	/// EventHandler or AsyncCompletedEventArgs as that would cause us to generate garbage.
	/// Instead we have substituted those events with a delegate based event that uses structs
	/// for arguments, allowing us to avoid garbage generation.
	/// 
	/// Additionally, we choose, in the built in implementations, to not throw an exception if 
	/// a single-invocation method is called while an operation is pending. Instead we simply 
	/// queue it up without issue. This is done as a convenience to the game developer, even if 
	/// it does deviate from the pattern.
	/// 
	/// We also choose not to support cancellation due to the complexities of the implementation
	/// and because there is little benefit from the ability to cancel a storage operation which
	/// should be a relatively quick process in and of itself.
